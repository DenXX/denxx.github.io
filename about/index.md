I am a Ph.D. student in the Intelligent Information Access Lab of Emory University, working with Prof. Eugene Agichtein. I got my bachelor and masters degree from Tula state university, Russia. After graduation I moved to Moscow and finished Yandex school of Data analysis. I worked in Yandex for three years focusing on the query-biased document summarization problem (machine learning, quality measures). Currently my research interests lie in the field of machine reading, knowledge extraction and representation.
