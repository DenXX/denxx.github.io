I've prepared a brief overview [slides about relation extraction for automatic knowledge base construction](http://mathcs.emory.edu/~dsavenk/slides/relation_extraction/) for [Emory NLP group](http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu/) meeting. The focus is on extractions from natural language text, but I tried to include some general slides as well to make it complete.

Feel free to comment and discuss.

Some slides were borrowed from a wonderful KDD 2014 tutorial: [Constructing and mining web-scale knowledge graphs](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/publications/papers/KDD14-T2-Bordes-Gabrilovich.pdf).
